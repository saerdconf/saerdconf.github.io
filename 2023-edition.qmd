title: "1st Southeast Asia’s Economic Research and Development Conference"
---

Economic research and development are crucial parts of our lives, contributing to economic growth and development in Southeast Asia. However, this region faces challenges with limited human resources and capital to produce studies on important topics that affect livelihoods and national progress. The challenges facing our economies seem to be growing continually. While many countries had not fully recovered from the “Great Recession,” the COVID-19 pandemic hit societies hard against the backdrop of rising unemployment, inequality, climate change, and political instability in the region.

The underfunding of systems has amplified the effects of recent economic and health shocks. It is concerning that voices are now calling for a return to austerity policies, while we should instead invest in industrial transition, infrastructure, and social cohesion policies. Despite the efforts of each government, addressing real problems requires more input from academia and stakeholders in formulating coherent policy proposals.

The avenues for economic research in Southeast Asia are developing both qualitatively and quantitatively, including issues of conceptualization, methodology, modeling, theory, and empirically calibrated policy formulation. There is an urgent need to pursue research on economic development and social inclusion.

This conference provides an opportunity for PhD students, young scholars, and researchers in economics and social science to share their research and exchange knowledge, as well as receive feedback from senior researchers and practitioners.
