As one of the most vibrant and diverse regions globally, it has achieved remarkable strides in economic growth, regional integration, and poverty reduction. However, this growth has been accompanied by rising inequality, environmental degradation, technological disruptions, and increasing vulnerabilities to global uncertainties and climate change. This raises critical questions: How can Southeast Asia balance its rapid economic growth with inequality, ecological change, and digital transformation? Furthermore, how does research on Southeast Asia help us to understand the socio-economic rules that govern the world? Addressing these polycrises requires innovative, multidimensional solutions that transcend traditional economic paradigms. The 3rd Southeast Asia Economic Research and Development Conference serves as a platform for young scholars, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to convene, exchange perspectives, and propose actionable solutions tailored to the region’s unique context.\nAdopting an interdisciplinary and pluralist approach, the conference aims to foster dialogue that integrates economic theory, empirical analysis, and practical policy interventions. By leveraging insights from various disciplines and methodologies, participants will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions shaping Southeast Asia’s socio-economic landscape.\nThe conference seeks to inspire bold and collaborative research that rethinks growth, sustainability, and equity within the region. The papers presented will not only enrich academic discourse but also provide a foundation for evidence-based policymaking to support inclusive and sustainable development in Southeast Asia. We welcome submissions that explore, but are not limited to, the following themes:"

    "text": "Economic research and development are crucial parts of our lives, contributing to economic growth and development in Southeast Asia. However, this region faces challenges with limited human resources and capital to produce studies on important topics that affect livelihoods and national progress. The challenges facing our economies seem to be growing continually. While many countries had not fully recovered from the “Great Recession,” the COVID-19 pandemic hit societies hard against the backdrop of rising unemployment, inequality, climate change, and political instability in the region.\nThe underfunding of systems has amplified the effects of recent economic and health shocks. It is concerning that voices are now calling for a return to austerity policies, while we should instead invest in industrial transition, infrastructure, and social cohesion policies. Despite the efforts of each government, addressing real problems requires more input from academia and stakeholders in formulating coherent policy proposals.\nThe avenues for economic research in Southeast Asia are developing both qualitatively and quantitatively, including issues of conceptualization, methodology, modeling, theory, and empirically calibrated policy formulation. There is an urgent need to pursue research on economic development and social inclusion.\nThis conference provides an opportunity for PhD students, young scholars, and researchers in economics and social science to share their research and exchange knowledge, as well as receive feedback from senior researchers and practitioners."
