Southeast Asia stands at the crossroads of dynamic economic progress and significant socio-economic challenges. As one of the most vibrant and diverse regions globally, it has achieved remarkable strides in economic growth, regional integration, and poverty reduction. However, this growth has been accompanied by rising inequality, environmental degradation, technological disruptions, and increasing vulnerabilities to global uncertainties and climate change. This raises critical questions: How can Southeast Asia balance its rapid economic growth with inequality, ecological change, and digital transformation? Furthermore, how does research on Southeast Asia help us to understand the socio-economic rules that govern the world?
Addressing these polycrises requires innovative, multidimensional solutions that transcend traditional economic paradigms. The 3rd Southeast Asia Economic Research and Development Conference serves as a platform for young scholars, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to convene, exchange perspectives, and propose actionable solutions tailored to the region’s unique context. 

Adopting an interdisciplinary and pluralist approach, the conference aims to foster dialogue that integrates economic theory, empirical analysis, and practical policy interventions. By leveraging insights from various disciplines and methodologies, participants will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions shaping Southeast Asia's socio-economic landscape.

The conference seeks to inspire bold and collaborative research that rethinks growth, sustainability, and equity within the region. The papers presented will not only enrich academic discourse but also provide a foundation for evidence-based policymaking to support inclusive and sustainable development in Southeast Asia. We welcome submissions that explore, but are not limited to, the following themes:

## Suggested Contribution Topics
- Economic growth, inequality, and inclusion
- Development and sustenance of social protection and social security system
